### Admin Page
The Admin Page has two main components: the Admin Panel Login Page and the Admin Home Panel Page. The Admin Page was created having both security and ease of use  in mind. On this page, the admin can enter data for a company, edit the information of the business or delete a company profile.


#### Admin Panel Login Page
On the Admin Panel Login Page, the administrator must enter a username and password to be granted access to the Admin Home Panel.Only after the login credentials are valided, the Admin can access the page and start making changes.

## Challenges
* Even thoght the team considered features for the application that will make the Marketplace better, we had to settle on delivering a product that serves the  needs of the stakeholder, due to time constraints.
* Using Json Web Tokens for server authentification of admin login was a new concept we first tackled for this project and it was challenging at first. 
* We wanted to ensure that the login and the stored personal information will be safe so we decided to used a SSL Certification. This process was a task that any of the team members have performed before,so it was time consuming.Some the steps involed are:
  * The stakeholder purchased a domain so we can point it at the IP address hosted on Linode. 
  * For the documentation of the process, in order to automatically enable HTTPS on the website, certbot was used.
  * Edit the root and SSH profiles to point the domain at the right IP address.



## Phase Two
Future iterations of this application will be able to have a user login page  Upon receiving login credentioals, the company owner can upload relevant information about their startup, edit their accounts as the business evolves and even delete it if they so desire.
