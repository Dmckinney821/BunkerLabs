            <p>Bunker Labs Marketplace Atlanta is a space 
                where users can view and connect with veteran-owned
                 businesses. Even though each business is unique, 
                 they all share a common trait in being owned or managed 
                 by a military veteran here in Atlanta. Our online platform 
                 displays each company's logo, their title, a summary of
                  their business, up to three needs the company may have, 
                  their contact information, their website, a picture of 
                  the CEO or owner, the company's industry and the current 
                  stage that the company is in. We believe each veteran 
                  entrepreneur should have access to all of the resources 
                  available and this platform allows them to market their 
                  company to future employees, investors, or volunteers.
